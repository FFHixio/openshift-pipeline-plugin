These files are leveraged by the test-openshift-pipeline-plugin job at https://ci.openshift.redhat.com/jenkins.
A test image based off of the jenkins image at https://github.com/openshift/jenkins will be built with the dockerfile
here and any openshift-pipeline.hpi file stored in the PR-Testing/jpi file as "openshift-pipeline.jpi".  In the case of
the test-openshift-pipeline-plugin job, it will be the hpi file from your PR.  But you can also test any local changes
you have to the plugin in the same way.

The `docker build` command used, if run from the same directory as this README, and if an "openshift-pipeline.jpi" file
exists in the "jpi" subdirectory, is:  docker build -f ./Dockerfile-jenkins-test-new-plugin -t openshift/jenkins-plugin-snapshot-test:latest .

The next step is to  then run the extended tests for the plugin located at https://github.com/openshift/origin.
From the top level directory of a clone of that repository, this command is run:  test/extended/core.sh --ginkgo.focus='openshift pipeline plugin' -ginkgo.v"

That extended test typically verifies the functionality of the openshift-pipeline plugin installed into OpenShift's official jenkins image (see https://github.com/openshift/jenkins),
but it will look for the local existence of the openshift/jenkins-plugin-snapshot-test:latest image, and if present, deploy and test against that image instead.
